# Docker with Maven Basics

* We learned `docker` and `docker-compose` basics.
* We can easily containerize our app, even if it needs database support.
* While creating images manually by yourself can be done, more human interaction leads to more errors.
* Delegating the image `build` process to maven gives you a lot of flexibility and also saves a lot of time. (This can be especially useful, if you have continuous integration flow set up, using Jenkins for example.)
* There are multiple maven plugins for docker. We will be working with
  * [fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin](https://github.com/fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin)
  * I like this one as this has lots of options and is highly configurable.
  * So much that you don’t even need a Dockerfile to build your own image when using this plugin.
  
> For this chapter we will use [Spring Simple Web App - `dockerfile-initial-complete`](https://github.com/amantuladhar/DockerKubernetesFiles/tree/dockerfile-initial-complete) branch.

## New Maven Goals
* If we use [fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin](https://github.com/fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin), we get few new maven goals.
* Some of the important one that we will cover
    * `docker:build`: This will build the docker image from the configuration we add to `pom.xml`.
    * `docker:start/stop`: Run/Stop the image built from configuration.
    * `docker:remove`: This is for cleaning up the images and containers.
    * `docker:logs`: This prints out the output of the running containers.

--- 
## Using Plugin
* To use the plugin in you app, you need to add  [fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin](https://github.com/fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin) to you pom.xml

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>io.fabric8</groupId>
            <artifactId>docker-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>0.28.0</version>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

* This plugins supports lots of configuration and we set those configuration inside `<configuration>` tag.

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>io.fabric8</groupId>
            <artifactId>docker-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>0.28.0</version>
            <configuration>
                <verbose>true</verbose>
                <images>
                    <image>
                       
                    </image>
                </images>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

* The important part in the plugin definition is the `<configuration>` element. 
* It has `<images>` element which allows us to add multiple `<image>`.
* There are two main elements in the `<image>`:
  * A `<build>` configuration specifying how images are built.
  * A `<run>` configuration describing how containers should be created and started. Think of this as option that you pass on `docker run` command.

---

* If you are using the the app from github you should have a `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine
WORKDIR /myApp
EXPOSE 8080
RUN apk add --no-cache curl
COPY ["target/*.jar", "./app.jar"]
CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
``` 

---
## Building with Dockerfile
* Let's add some configuration using `build` tag.

```xml
<image>
    <name>docker-kubernetes:${project.version}</name>
    <build>
        <dockerFileDir>${project.basedir}</dockerFileDir>
        <dockerFile>Dockerfile</dockerFile>
    </build>
</image>
```

* To build the dockerfile you just need to run `./mvnw clean package docker:build`. It will build your app.
* Default value for `<dockerFileDir>` is `/src/main/docker`.
* We have our `Dockerfile` inside project root directory, so we are overriding the value.

---
## Run using `docker:start`

* It is as simple as `./mvnw package docker:start`.

```bash
...
...
[INFO] --- docker-maven-plugin:0.28.0:start (default-cli) @ cloudnative ---
[INFO] DOCKER> [docker-kubernetes:v1-web]: Start container b9cbcab4c5a6
...
```
* If you list the running container you can see that one container is running.
* Of course we cannot access the app, we haven't published the port yet.

---
## Stop using `docker:stop`
* To stop the running container you can use `./mvnw package docker:stop`

```bash
...
...
[INFO] --- docker-maven-plugin:0.28.0:stop (default-cli) @ cloudnative ---
[INFO] DOCKER> [docker-kubernetes:v1-web]: Stop and removed container b9cbcab4c5a6 after 0 ms
...
```

---
## Port Publishing
* We can publish the port easily as well.
* For this plugin we add configuration inside `<run>` tag.
* Inside `<run>` tag we use `<ports>` tag to expose ports.
* Every port mapping are put inside `<port>` tag.

```xml
<image>
    <name>docker-kubernetes:${project.version}</name>
    <build>
        <dockerFileDir>${project.basedir}</dockerFileDir>
        <dockerFile>Dockerfile</dockerFile>
    </build>
    <run>
        <ports>
            <port>9090:8080</port>
        </ports>
    </run>
</image>
```
* `build` and `run` you app again and you will be able to access it from the host this time.

---
## See the logs
* If you want to see the logs just use `docker:logs` goal.

---
## Removing images you created
* This goal can be used to clean up images and containers. 
* By default all images with a build configuration are removed.

---
## Build image without using `Dockerfile`
* The plugin we are using supports creating `Dockerfile` in memory.
* Inside the `<build>` tag, we can write `Dockerfile` like instructions.

```xml
<image>
    <name>docker-kubernetes:${project.version}</name>
    <build>
        <from>openjdk:8-jre-alpine</from>
        <assembly>
            <descriptorRef>artifact</descriptorRef>
        </assembly>
        <cmd>java -jar maven/${project.name}-${project.version}.jar</cmd>
    </build>
    <run>
        <ports>
            <port>9090:8080</port>
        </ports>
    </run>
</image>
```
* `<from>` is same as `FROM` instruction.
* `<assembly>` defines how build artifacts and other files can enter the Docker image. Using this we don't need to use `COPY` to copy our build artifact.
* Inside `<assembly>` we are using `<descriptorRef>` which has some predefined ways to copy files to image.
  * `artifact-with-dependencies`: Attaches project’s artifact and all its dependencies. Also, when a classpath file exists in the target directory, this will be added to.
  * `artifact`: Attaches only the project’s artifact but no dependencies.
  * `project`: Attaches the whole Maven project but with out the target/ directory.
  * `rootWar`: Copies the artifact as ROOT.war to the exposed directory. I.e. Tomcat will then deploy the war under the root context.
* We are using `artifact` pre defined desriptor in our configuration.
* `<cmd>` is same as `CMD` instruction.
* Build and run your app again. Your will be able to access your app from the host.
