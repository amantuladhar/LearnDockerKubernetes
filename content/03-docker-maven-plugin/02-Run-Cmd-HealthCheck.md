# Run Command, Restart Polices and HealthCheck

---
## Run Command
* How to add `RUN` instruction when using `in-memory` Dockerfile.

```xml
<build>
    ...
    <runCmds>
        <run>apk add --no-cache curl</run>
    </runCmds>
    <cmd>java -jar maven/${project.name}-${project.version}.jar</cmd>
</build>
``` 
* `<runCmds>` can have mutiple `<run>` tag.
* Here we are installing `curl`.

---
## Restart Policy
* If you want to restart policies for your images, you can use `<restartPolicy>` tag.

```xml
<run>
    <restartPolicy>
        <name>on-failure</name>
        <retry>3</retry>
    </restartPolicy>
    ...
</run>
```
* `<restartPolicy>` can is added inside of `<run>` tag.
* It has `<name>` and `<retry>` children tag.
* `<name>` take the type of policy you want to enforce.
* `<retry>` how many times you want to restart your image, when `on-failure` policy is used.

---
## Healthcheck
* We can add a healthcheck in our image as well.
* We use `<healthCheck>` tag, which has few child tags.

```xml
<build>
    ...
    <healthCheck>
        <interval>10s</interval>
        <timeout>5s</timeout>
        <startPeriod>10s</startPeriod>
        <retries>3</retry>
        <cmd>curl --fail http://localhost:8080/test/status-5xx || exit 1</cmd>
    </healthCheck>
</build>
```
* We use `<healthCheck>` tag inside `<build>` tag.
* It has few children tags, which represents the option health check supports.
* `/test/status-5xx` will throw Internal Server Error after 6h request. So for time being image will be healty and after couple of minutes it will be tagged as unhealthy.
