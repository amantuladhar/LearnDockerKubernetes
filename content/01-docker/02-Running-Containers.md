# Basic Docker Commands

## Running container

### `docker run @image`
* Let's start with simple image `hello-world`.
* To run that image execute `docker run hello-world`.
* Here's a output you will get

```bash
➜ docker run hello-world   
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
1b930d010525: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:2557e3c07ed1e38f26e389462d03ed943586f744621577a99efb77324b0fe535
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

```
* If you look at the output you will see that `docker` does few things for us.
* It will check if the image is available locally. 
* If not, it will be pulled down from the remote repository. 
* It initializes the image's name and resources containers needs like CPU, IP, Memory etc. 
* After that it will **run** the container.
* When container is started, it will execute a command.
* Command is defined in image itself. We will talk about this later.

## Listing local images

### `docker image list`
* Or `docker images`
* Lists the images that are available in your local system.
* You can use any version of command you like.

```bash
➜ docker image list                 
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
hello-world         latest              fce289e99eb9        6 weeks ago         1.84kB
```

---
## Listing container
* When we ran the image with `docker run` it creates a container. Duh!! it is the defination of container.
* How can you see list of your container?

### `docker container list`
* Or `docker ps`
* Use any of the command above and you will see, list of **running** container.

```bash
➜ docker container list 
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

```
* I don't see our container here, why?
* Because `hello-world` is a simple image.
* It executes one command and exits, hence container is stopped.

### `--all`
* If you want to see container that are stopped you can use `--all` option.
* `docker container list --all` OR `docker ps --all`

```bash
➜ docker container list --all
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES
bb11cd638c55        hello-world         "/hello"            9 minutes ago       Exited (0) 9 minutes ago                       stoic_shtern

```
* Now we are able to see our container in the list.

---
## Override default image command
* After `docker run @image` we can pass **@command** and **@argument** it accepts.
* Like `docker run @image @command @arguments`.
* For this we will use another simple image `busybox`.
* `busybox` has simple unix command which we can use.

### `docker run busybox sleep 5000`
* `docker run busybox sleep 5000`
* This will run a busybox and at the end it will execute the command `sleep 5000`. 
* This kind of emulates a long running process, as container will not stop unless command exits.
* If you list the container right now (in new terminal of course), you will see status is different.
* It is not **Exited**.

```bash
➜ docker container list      
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
d7acdce83ad6        busybox             "sleep 5000"        23 seconds ago      Up 21 seconds                           gallant_hodgkin

```

## Stopping running continers

### `docker container stop @id / @name`
* Or `docker stop @id / @name`
* To stop the container you can either use name or you can use name of the container.
* If you list the image again (don't forget `--all`) you will see updated status for the container.
* If you pass `space` separated `@id / @name` to stop more than one container.

---
## Running container in background
* When we ran `docker run busybox sleep 5000`, it blocked out terminal.
* If you don't want that to happen, we have an option to run the container in background mode.

### `-d` option
* If you pass `-d` option, when running the container it will run in background.
* `docker run @options @image @command @arguments`
* `docker run -d busybox sleep 5000`
* If you run above command, it will echo container id and resume it's process in background.

---
## Start the stopped container
### `docker start @name/@id`
* It will start the existing container instaed of createing new one.
* Not recommended, as container are supposed to be disposable.
