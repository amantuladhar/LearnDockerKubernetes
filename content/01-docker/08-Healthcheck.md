# Docker Healthcheck

## What is `HEALTHCHECK`
* The `HEALTHCHECK` instruction tells Docker how to test a container to check that it is still working. 
* There could be a scenario where our application process is still running, but may not respond to our request.
* `HEALTHCHECK` instruction helps us to identify this issue.
* We can have multiple `HEALTHCHECK` instruction in our `Dockerfile` but only last one will take an effect.
* Note: Kubernetes doesn't support this `HEALTHCHECK` instruction. Kubernetes has its own way to checking if containers are healthy.
* When a container has a `HEALTHCHECK` specified, it has a health status in addition to its normal status. 

### HEALTHCHECK
* The `HEALTHCHECK` instruction can be used in two forms.
* `HEALTHCHECK [OPTIONS] CMD command`. Which checks container health by running a command inside the container.
* `HEALTHCHECK NONE`. This will disable any healthcheck inherited from the base image.

---
* If you are using the app from [Simple Spring App](https://github.com/amantuladhar/DockerKubernetesFiles/tree/dockerfile-initial), make sure you are in `dockerfile-initial` branch.
* We have couple of REST endpoints in the app
  * `/test/` which kind of hello-world endpoint for us 
  * `/test/status-5xx` which will return status 200 for first 5 times, but after that it will throw exception. Our app will still be running.
  * `/test/exit-1` to exit the app with non-zero status code.
  * `/test/exit-0` to exit the app with zero status code.

---
* Let's add `HEALTHCHECK` in our image.
* `HEALTHCHECK CMD curl --fail http://localhost:8080/test || exit 1`
* We are making a curl request to our app and if it fails we are exiting our app with status code 1.

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine
WORKDIR /myApp
EXPOSE 8080
RUN apk add --no-cache curl
COPY ["target/*.jar", "./app.jar"]
CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
HEALTHCHECK CMD curl --fail http://localhost:8080/test || exit 1
```
* Let's build and run this image.
```bash
IMAGE                                 STATUS                    
docker-kubernetes:dockerfile-basics   Up XX seconds (healthy)
```
* We will play around with `HEALTHCHECK` more, but first let's learn about different options `HEALTHCHECK` supports. 

### `--interval`
* `--interval=@duration`
* Default duration time is 30s
* This configures time `HEALTHCHECK` needs to wait before it runs next `HEALTHCHECK CMD`.

### `--timeout`
* `--timeout=@duration`
* Default timeout is 30s
* This configures the time it should take a `HEALTHCHECK CMD` to finish.
* If a single `CMD` run takes longer than timeout seconds then the check is considered to have failed.

### `--retries`
* `--retries=@numberOfRetries`
* Default value for retry is 3.
* This configures how many times `HEALTHCHECK` needs to fail before it determines out container is unhealthy.

### `--start-period`
* `--start-period=@duration`
* Default value for start period duration is 0s.
* With is option we can configure time it will take for app to run.
* If we run pre-mature `HEALTHCHECK` our app mignt not have initialized and it may result in our container be in unhealthy state.
* Basically it will run our first `HEALTHCHECK CMD` after time specified.

### Playing with HEALTHCHECK
* Let's update our `HEALTHCHECK` instruction.
```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine
WORKDIR /myApp
EXPOSE 8080
RUN apk add --no-cache curl
COPY ["target/*.jar", "./app.jar"]
CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
HEALTHCHECK  --start-period=10s --interval=15s --timeout=5s --retries=3 \
             CMD curl --fail http://localhost:8080/test/status-5xx || exit 1
```

* Build you image and run it. And keep an eye on health status.
* Remember status-5xx will return status 200 for first 5 calls
* So for a minute or so our container health will be *healthy*.
* But because the `HEALTHCHECK` is called frequently, and for our app at exactly 6th call it will start to fail.
* On a 6th call it won't flag our container as *unhealthy* as we defined `retries`.
* Docker makes sure that three consecutive failure happeds before it flags the container as *unhealthy*.

docker-kubernetes:dockerfile-basics    10 seconds ago      Up 10 seconds (health: starting)
```

docker-kubernetes:dockerfile-basics   2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes (unhealthy)
