# Restart Policies
* Restart policies is used to control whether your containers starts automatically when they exit, or even when Docker restarts.
* Restart policies tells Docker how to react when a container shuts down.
* A restart policy only takes effect after a container **starts successfully**. 
* Starting successfully means that the container is **up for at least 10 seconds** and Docker has started monitoring it. 
* This prevents a container which does not start at all from going into a restart loop.
* By using the `--restart` option with the docker run command you can specify a restart policy. 
* Type of restart policies
  * `no`
  * `always`
  * `on-failure`
  * `unless-stopped`

---  
## `no`
* The no policy is the default restart policy and simply will not restart a container under any case.

---  
## `always`
* If we wanted the container to be restarted no matter what exit code the command has, we can use the `always` restart policy. 
* The restart policy will always restart the container. 
* Whenever the Docker service is restarted, containers using the always policy will also be restarted.

---  
## `on-failure`
* Restart your container whenever it exits with a non-zero exit status and not restart otherwise. 
* You can optionally provide a number of times for Docker to attempt to restart the container.
* `--restart=on-failure:@number`
* Docker uses a delay between restarting the container, to prevent flood-like protection. 
* This is an increasing delay; it starts with the value of 100 milliseconds, then Docker will double the previous delay.
* If a container is successfully restarted, the delay is reset to the default value of 100 milliseconds

---  
## `unless-stopped`
* Again, similar to always, if we want the container to be restarted regardless of the exit code, we can use `unless-stopped.` 
* It will restart the container regardless of the exit status, but do not start it on daemon startup if the container has been put to a stopped state before.

---  
* If you are using the app from [Simple Spring App](https://github.com/amantuladhar/DockerKubernetesFiles/tree/dockerfile-initial), make sure you are in `dockerfile-initial` branch.
* We have couple of REST endpoints in the app
  * `/test/` which kind of hello-world endpoint for us 
  * `/test/status-5xx` which will return status 200 for first 5 times, but after that it will throw exception. Our app will still be running.
  * `/test/exit-1` to exit the app with non-zero status code.
  * `/test/exit-0` to exit the app with zero status code.

---

* Let's start our app using `on-failure`
* Here's a `Dockerfile` content.

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine
WORKDIR /myApp
EXPOSE 8080
RUN apk add --no-cache curl
COPY ["target/*.jar", "./app.jar"]
CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

* Build and run the image.
* `docker run -d -p 9090:8080 `**`--restart=on-failure`**` docker-kubernetes:dockerfile-basics`

```bash
IMAGE                                 STATUS              
docker-kubernetes:dockerfile-basics   Up About a minute   
```

* Let's call `/test/exit-1`, which will end the process with non zero exit code.

```bash
IMAGE                                 STATUS                     
docker-kubernetes:dockerfile-basics   Restarting (1) 1 second ago
```

* Now let's call `/test/exit-0`, which will end the process with zero exit code.
* If you list the running container, you won't see it now.

## Update restart policies of running container
* `docker update --restart=new-policies @id/@name`
* Where `@id/@name` is of container
