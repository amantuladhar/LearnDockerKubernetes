# Attaching Container Terminal To Host Terminal

## `-it` option
* `-it` option will attach container terminal to our host
* After that we can issue command directly to container.
* `i` meaning interactive
* `t` meaning tty
* `docker run -it busybox`
* After that every command you issue will be inside the container.
* (Play around with some command)
* If you want to get out of the container you can **exit** the terminal.
* If default command in image is not **shell**, we can pass shell as `@argument`.
* `docker run -it busybox /bin/sh`

## `docker container exec`
* `docker container exec` is used to execute command inside running container.
* `docker container exec @id @command`
* Or `docker exec`
* But we can use same option here `-it` and pass in **shell** as command. (Which is default for busybox)
* So `docker container exec -it @id` will attach container terminal to host.
* If you run `ps aux` inside the container, you can see `sleep 5000` is a running process.

```bash
âžœ docker container exec -it @id
/ # ps aux
PID   USER     TIME  COMMAND
    1 root      0:00 sleep 5000
    9 root      0:00 /bin/sh
   16 root      0:00 ps aux
/ # 

```


## Attach Terminal When Start The Stopped Container
### `docker start -ia @name/@id`
* If you want to attach the terminal, the option is bit different i.e `-ia`
