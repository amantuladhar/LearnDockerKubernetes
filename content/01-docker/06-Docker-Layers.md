# Docker Layers

## What is docker layers?
* Layer is basically a change on an image, or an intermediate image. 
* Every instructions you specify `(FROM, RUN, COPY, etc.)` in your `Dockerfile` causes the previous image to change, thus creating a new layer. 
* That image layer then becomes the parent for the layer created by the next instruction.
* Final image  and/or image that we use consists of a series of layers which are stacked, one on top of the another.
* You can think of it as staging changes when you're using **git**. You add a file's change, then another one, then another one.

---
* When you build your image before, you also created lots of images.
* `docker build . -t docker-kubernetes:dockerfile-basics`
