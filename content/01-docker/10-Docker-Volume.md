# Docker Volume

* Volumes are directories (or files) that are outside of the default Union File System and exist as normal directories and files on the host filesystem.

## Why do we need volume?
* To understand why we need volumes letâ€™s go back to simple image `busybox`.
* `docker run -it busybox`
  * Create a directory and add a file. `touch test.txt`
  * Run new container with same image, list the files and you won't see the file you created.
  * Why not run same container? If we run same container we will still see that file.
  * Remember container are ephemeral and disposable.
  * We should not depend on starting same container.
* How do we persist changes, so that when we run new container we see that file? 
  
## `-v @name:@path`
* The most direct way is declare a volume at run-time with the `-v @name:@path` flag.
* `@name` is name of the volume.
* `@path` is the path inside container. 
* `docker run `**`-v myVolume:/my-volume`**` -it busybox`
* This will make the directory `/my-volume` inside the container live outside the UFS and directly accessible on the host.
* Any files that the image held inside the `/my-volume` directory will be copied into the volume.
* If the continerPath specified doens't exist docker will create one for you.
* Where can I find the file in host system?

---
* We can see where docker is storing our file by inspecting the container.  
* `docker inspect @containerId`
* If you see **"Mounts"** property, you will see properties like
  * **"Source"** is path in the host
  * **"Destination"** is path in the continer
* If you try to navigate to path specified by **"Source"** in you computer, you won't find it. Why?
* For docker that host path is inside Virtual Machine.

---
* We can also see `docker volume list` to list all volumes.
* As you can see volume name is big hash at the moment 
* `docker volume create --name @volume-name` to create your volume before hand.
---

* If you attach a same volume when runnnig new container you will will still be present.

```bash
docker run -v myVolume:/my-volume -it busybox

# Create a file inside my-volume directory
> touch my-volume/test.txt

# List content of my-volume directory
> ls my-volume/
test.txt

```
* Running new container with same volume

```bash
docker run -v myVolume:/my-volume -it busybox
# List content of my-volume directory
> ls my-volume/
test.txt
```
