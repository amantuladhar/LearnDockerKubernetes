# Understanding Kubernetes

## Why do we need Kubernetes?
* We learned `docker`, `docker-compose`. We know how to containerize our web app. Why do we need to learn yet another tool?
* Note that `docker` and `docker-compose` runs on single host.
* With help of Kubernetes we can run our app in multi-host environment.
* With Kubernetes we can easily deploy and run your software components without having to know about the actual servers underneath.
* It doesn't matter if it has single host or it has multiple-host or clusters.
* When deploying a multi-component application through Kubernetes, it selects a server for each component, deploys it.
* It also makes it easy to find and communicate with all the other components of your application.
* Kubernetes enables you to run your applications on thousands of computer nodes as if all those nodes were a single, enormous computer. 
* It abstracts away the underlying infrastructure and, by doing so, simplifies development, deployment.
* Kubernetes can be thought of as an operating system for the cluster

## Kubernetes Architecture As Simple As Possible

* Kubernetes architecture in its simpletest form has two most important component.
  * `Kubernetes Master`
  * `Kubernetes Worker`

                    +----------------------+
```

## Kubernetes Master
* As a user we always communicate to `Kubernetes Master`. We will use `kubectl` tool to interact with `Kubernetes Master`.
* `Kubernetes Master` (Control Plane) has a sub components
   * `Kubernetes API Server`, which you and the other Control Plane components communicate with
   * `Scheduler`, which schedules your apps (assigns a worker node to each deployable component of your application)
   * `Controller Manager`, which performs cluster-level functions, such as replicating components, keeping track of worker nodes, handling node failures, and so on
   * `etcd`, a reliable distributed data store that persistently stores the cluster configuration.

## Kubernetes Worker
* `Kubernetes Worker` the run your containerized applications. 
* The task of running, monitoring, and providing services to your applications is done `Workers`.
* `Kubernetes Worker` have different components.
  * `Container Runtime`: Docker, rkt, or anotherÂ container runtime, which runs your containers.
  * `Kubelet`, which talks to the `API server` and manages containers on its node.
  * `Kubernetes Service Proxy (kube-proxy)`, which load-balances network traffic between application components.

+------------------------------------------------+

```

## Nodes
* Within a cloud we can have lots of nodes, which may or may not be on same machine.
* It is a part of Kubernetes to abstract out these details.
* We always communicate with `Master` which may be on same node as `Worker` or may be on different.
