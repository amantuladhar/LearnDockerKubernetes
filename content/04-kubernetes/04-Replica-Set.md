# Kubernetes `ReplicaSets`

* We now know how to create pods, i.e manually.
* But in real world we never want to create a pod manually.
* We always use higher level construct to manage pods.
* One of the higher level construct that we use to mange pods is `ReplicaSet`. (Although we will use one more higher level construct that manages `ReplicaSet` later).
* A `ReplicaSet` ensures the pods it manages are always kept running. 
* If the pod disappears for any reason, `ReplicaSet` notices the missing pod and creates a replacement pod.

## How does `ReplicaSets` work?
* `ReplicaSet` constantly monitors the list of running pods.
* Label selector is used to filter the pods that `ReplicaSet` manages.
* `RepliaSet` makes sure the actual number of pods it manages always matches the desired number. 
* If too few such pods are running, it creates new replicas from a pod template. 
* If too many such pods are running, it removes the excess replicas.

## Defining `ReplicaSet` yaml file

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1             # 1                           
kind: ReplicaSet                # 2                      
metadata:                       # 3               
  name: v1-web                  # 4                    
  labels:                       # 5               
    version: v1                 # 5                     
    env: prod                   # 5                   
spec:                           # 6           
  replicas: 3                   # 6                   
  selector:                     # 8                 
    matchLabels:                # 9                   
      version: v1               # 10                      
      env: prod                 # 10                  
  template:
    # After this it just a Pod template we had before                                                                   
    metadata:                                                                   
      name: v1-web                                                                   
      labels:                   # 11                                                
        version: v1             # 12                                                      
        env: prod               # 12                                                    
    spec:                                                                   
      containers:                                                                   
        - image: amantuladhar/docker-kubernetes:v1-web                                                                   
          name: v1-web                                                                   
          livenessProbe:                                                                   
            httpGet:                                                                   
              path: /test/                                                                   
              port: 8080                                                                   
          ports:                                                                   
            - containerPort: 8080                                                                   
```
* `#1`: `ReplicaSet` are defined under `apiVersion` **apps/v1**.
* `#2`: We are setting our resource type to `ReplicaSet`.
* `#3`: Defines the metadata information for our resource.
* `#4`: We are setting the name for our `ReplicaSet`.
* `#5`: `labels` includes label added for a `ReplicaSet`.
* `#6`:  `spec` includes the specification for our resource.
* `#7`: `replicas` tells ReplicaSet how many copies of pods we want. ReplicaSet make sure that specified number of pods are always running.
* `#8`: `selector` will have list of labels that `ReplicaSet` will target. These are the labels that determines which pods are managed by `ReplicaSet`. This selector must some how match labels defined in `#12`, `#13`.
* `#9`: `matchLabels` indicate that we are trying to value label key with label value.
  * We also have `matchExpression` which is more expressive. (More on this later).
* `template` is the template for the pod our ReplicaSet manages. When starting the ReplicaSet or adding new Pods, it will use this template to start the Pod.
  * Notice: All properties below `template` is same as Pod `yaml` file we defined before.
  
## Create `ReplicaSet`
* To create a `ReplicaSet` we simply use `kubectl create -f replicaset.yaml`.

```bash
➜ kubectl create -f replicaset.yaml
replicaset.apps/v1-web created
```

## Listing `ReplicaSet`.
* To list the `ReplicaSet` we use same command like before but different resource.
* `kubectl get replicaset` or `kubectl get rs`.
* `rs` is the short form for `replicaset`.

```bash
➜ kubectl get replicaset           
NAME     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
v1-web   3         3         3       42s

➜ kubectl get rs        
NAME     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
v1-web   3         3         3       44s
``` 

### List the pods
* If you list the running pods, you will see you have three pods running.

```bash
➜ k get po
NAME           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
v1-web-8s5zw   1/1     Running   0          3m36s
v1-web-r9pkw   1/1     Running   0          3m36s
v1-web-xk9sk   1/1     Running   0          3m36s
```
* `po` is short form for `pods`.

## Scale Up
* If we ever want to scale up our application, it will be very easy now.
* There are many ways you can scale your pods, but I will use `kubectl apply`.
* Let's update the number of replicas we want in our yaml file. Set it to 10.

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 10
```
* After that run: `kubectl apply -f replicaset.yaml`
* List the pod again, you will see number of running pods will increase.

```bash
➜ k get po
NAME           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
v1-web-8s5zw   1/1     Running   0          6m48s
v1-web-fdnwf   1/1     Running   0          8s
v1-web-l6dbh   1/1     Running   0          8s
v1-web-lxkp7   1/1     Running   0          8s
v1-web-n6rfh   1/1     Running   0          8s
v1-web-q9zdq   1/1     Running   0          8s
v1-web-r9pkw   1/1     Running   0          6m48s
v1-web-s455s   1/1     Running   0          8s
v1-web-xctpn   1/1     Running   0          8s
v1-web-xk9sk   1/1     Running   0          6m48s
```

## Scale Down
* Scaling down is super easy as well.
* Just update the replicas value. Set it to 3 for now.

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 2
```
* After that run: `kubectl apply -f replicaset.yaml`. You will see pods are deleted.

## Using `matchExpression`
* We saw how `matchLabels` works in previous example.
* But `ReplicaSet` can have more expressive label selector than just matching key and value pairs.

```yaml
selector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: @label_key
        operator: @operator_value
        values:
          - @label_value
          - @label_value
```
* When we use `matchExpressions` we have few option that we can tweak.
* We can have multiple `matchExpression` as well.
* `key` will take a `label` key.
* `operator` will take one of the pre-defined operators
  * `In`: Label’s value must match one of the specified values.
  * `NotIn`: Label’s value must not match any of the specified values.
  * `Exists`: Pod must include a label with the specified key. When using this operator, you shouldn’t specify the values field.
  * `DoesNotExist`: Pod must not include a label with the specified key. The values property must not be specified.
* `values`: If we use `In` or `NotIn` list of values to look for.

---
* Let's generate the scenario where we can work on.
* First run the `ReplicaSet` yaml file you had before.
* You will end up with three Pods. Override one of Pod label env=prod to env=dev
* The Pod whose label was change is now no longer managed by our ReplicaSet. i.e new Pod will be created for us
* If you list the running Pod you will see we have 4 pods.

```bash
➜ k get pods -L version,env                    
NAME           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   VERSION   ENV
v1-web-8s5zw   1/1     Running   0          31m   v1        dev
v1-web-njbt9   1/1     Running   0          5s    v1        prod
v1-web-r9pkw   1/1     Running   0          31m   v1        prod
v1-web-xk9sk   1/1     Running   0          31m   v1        prod
```
* How do we tell `ReplicaSet` to manage Pods with label env=dev and env=prod.
* How to not create extra Pod?

### Using Operator
* Let's update our `ReplicaSet` label selector to

```yaml
selector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: env
        operator: In
        values:
          - dev
          - prod
```
* Using `In` we can define that ReplicaSet can look for either value `dev` or `prod` for label `env`.
* If we update one of the pod label env to dev now, it won't create new Pod. As updated Pod is still managed by `ReplicaSet` and replicas count match the desired state.

```bash
➜ k label po v1-web-6bcgx env=dev --overwrite
pod/v1-web-6bcgx labeled
```
* Now list the pods.

```bash
NAME           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     VERSION   ENV
v1-web-6bcgx   1/1     Running   0          6m22s   v1        dev
v1-web-mkk79   1/1     Running   0          6m22s   v1        prod
v1-web-sxl59   1/1     Running   0          6m22s   v1        prod
```
