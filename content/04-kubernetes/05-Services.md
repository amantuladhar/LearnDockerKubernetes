# Kubernetes Services

* Now we know how to mange Pods using `ReplicaSet`.
* You know that `ReplicaSet` make sure that desired number of Pods are always alive.
* One very important thing we should remember is that Pods are disposable, they should be easily replacable.
* Another thing we need to remember is that, there can be multiple Pods that serves the same content.
* How do we keep tract of Pods IP. Pods can scale up / down, how to know new IP of pods when they are added.
* If Pods is unhealthy, they are replaced. They may or may not get the same IP.

---
## What is Service
* Service is a resource that makes a single, constant point of entry to a group of pods providing the same service. 
* Each service is assigned a IP and port that never change while the service exists. 
* Using service IP we can communicate with Pods that service manages.
* Service also manages Pods using label selector.

---
## Service Definition
* To create a Service, you create a resource with `kind: Service`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1           
kind: Service            # 1
metadata:                
  name: v1-web-svc       # 2
spec:                    
  type: NodePort         # 3
  ports:                 
    - port: 80           # 4
      targetPort: 8080   # 5
      nodePort: 30000    # 6
  selector:              # 7
    env: prod            
    version: v1          
```
* `#1`: We are defining the type of resource to `Service`.
* `#2`: Name of the service.
* `#3`: Type of Service. Default is `ClusterIP` but if we use `ClusterIP` it be visible only inside cluster.
  * `NodePort` will expose set of Pod it manages to external client.
* `#4`: Expose external endpoint to port 80. Type `NodePort` will ignore this properties.
* `#5`: `targetPort` is the port container listining to.
* `#6`: `nodePort` will use this IP to expose the service to external client. It must be range from 30000-32767.
* `#7`: This is the label selector that is used by Service to select the Pods.
* `minikube` doesn't support `LoadBalancer` as of now.

## Create a Service
* You can create a service by using `kubectl create -f svc.yaml`.

## Listing the Service
* To list the services in cluster you use `kubectl get svc`, where `svc` is short form for service.

---
## Access the Pods externally
* Now that service is running, we can access our app from outside.
* If you try `localhost:30000/test` it will not work. Why?
* Remember Kubernetes is running inside minikube cluster, which is running inside Virtual Machine.
* We can use `minikube service @service_name` to easily access your services through your browser.
