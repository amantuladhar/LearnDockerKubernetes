# Docker Compose

---
## What is docker compose?
* `docker compose` is tool for defining and running complex applications with Docker. 
* With Compose, we define a **multi-container application** in a single file.
* It allows you to spin your application up in a single command.
* Orchestration between two containers are easy with docker compose.
* Default file name for docker-compose is is `docker-compose.yml`.

> Docker Compose works in the scope of a single host, where Kubernetes works on multi cluster environment.

## Simple compose file
* This is what a simple compose file looks like.
```yaml
version: '3'                                         # 1    
services:                                            # 2
  myApp:                                             # 3
    image: amantuladhar/docker-kubernetes:v1-web     # 4 
```
* `#1` specifies what version of compose API you want to use.
* `#2` is a root property. It includes list of all services (containers) compose will manage.
* `#3` is name of the service (container)
* `#4` specifies image you want to run.

> If you want to build you app yourself you can find the app in [Spring Simple Web](https://github.com/amantuladhar/DockerKubernetesFiles/tree/compose-initial) branch `compose-initial`.

* You noticed that in compose containers are called **services**.
* Compose can manage multiple serivices, but for now we are dealing with only one.
* We defined the service called `myApp` which will run the image.

### Build your image
* If you want to build your own image instead of using one, you can do that easily too

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  myApp:
    build:                     # 1  
      context: .               # 2
      dockerfile: Dockerfile   # 3 
```
* `#1` build tag will let compose know that you want to build your image.
* `#2` context defines where you docker file are stored
* `#3` dockerfile takes the file name for `Dockerfile`. If the file name is `Dockerfile` you don't seed to specify the property.
* You use `docker-commpose build` to build your image.
* If you make any changes to `Dockerfile` you need to explicitely build the image again.

---

## Running sevices
* To run the services defined in compose file is super easy.
* You run any number of services defined inside compose file with single command.
* i.e **`docker-compose up`**.
* If you want to run it in background add `-d` option.
* If you run the app right now, it will run but it won't be accessable from our host yet.
* We need to publish ports first in order to access the app.

---

## Stopping services
* Starting the services were easy. How about stopping them?
* It is super easy as well. `docker-compose stop`
* It will stop all running services at once.
